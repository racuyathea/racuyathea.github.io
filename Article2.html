				<h3 style = "font-size: 40px;"> An Article on People Choosing Incompetent Candidates </h3>

				<h6> By: Bryan James A. Pidazo | 2019 May 12 </h6>

						Under democracy, it is up to a country&#39s citizens to decide which individuals are qualified to be elected
						as leaders of the country (Lozada, 2013). The idea is that people are given the power to be directly responsible for who
						runs their country, this makes it so that citizens are free to choose the candidate who they trust and who
						they believe are qualified to be elected. Unfortunately, in the Philippine government, it is the corrupt and
						incompetent who end up within its court, but how come? It was the voters who elected these individuals to be
						responsible for their country, but why? Why do they constantly give away their very important votes to corrupt
						politicians and officials? There are several reasons for that but let&#39s begin with the ignorance of the voters
						within the country.

					</h5>

						Okay, &#39ignorance&#39 may be too strong a word, but before anything one should first understand the requirements
						to be an eligible voter. First, they must be at least 18 years of age, and a resident of the Philippines for
						at least 1 year and in the place where in he/she proposes to vote, for at least 6 months immediately preceding
						the elections. 

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Disqualifications for registry are also as follows: Any person who has been sentenced by final judgment to suffer
						imprisonment for not less than 1 year, any person who has been adjudged by final judgment by a competent court
						or tribunal of having committed rebellion, insurrection, violation of the firearms laws, or any crime against national
						security unless restored to his (or her) full civil and political rights in accordance with law and finally, any
						insane or incompetent person as declared by competent authority (COMELEC, n.d.). 

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Now that&#39s basically it, no education required, just be 18, don&#39t be insane and you are now responsible
						for the selection of your country&#39s leaders for the next several years. The obvious issue with that is that the
						lower class, which make up the majority of the Philippine population, who are unable to acquire educational
						opportunities or have never even enrolled in education at all are eligible voters in the election. It&#39s these people,
						who are easily swayed by running candidates that decide who gets to run their government.

						Another thing worth noting is that these people don&#39t have the resources to acquire the information they need to
						understand how qualified a candidate actually is (Sarmiento, 2013). All they need to know about someone is how selfish they appear to
						be. Candidates who are shown to be helpful to poor communities and offer free education to lucky families get the
						obvious upper hand in votes compared to candidates who provide effective and needed platforms because but have less
						advertising campaigns. &#39Why choose someone I don&#39t recognize when a popular celebrity who gives free education is
						running for the same position?&#39 is the thought that unfortunately, lower class voters follow.

					</h5>

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Still, it&#39s not their fault that they don&#39t know. Some of these advertising campaigns can be very manipulative
						and targeted specifically towards that lower class of voters (Avila, 2015). Candidates know that people like that sort of thing
						and they exploit it as a means of getting the advantage in the polls, and sadly that&#39s just the way things are.
						Additionally, not all voters are uneducated. Middle and high class citizens are also eligible for voting too,
						but based on the individuals who have been running for government positions in the past years, middle class voting
						probably just goes along the lines of voting for the candidate that&#39s less evil than the other, and this is quite
						the terrible truth of the Philippine elections.
