				<h3 style = "font-size: 40px;"> An Article on <br> Excessive Campaign Spending </h3>

						This is important? Good question. I asked myself the same thing, but yes this does matter and I&#39ll go over why that is.
						First of all, why does excessive spending matter? There is a limit set for each candidate to ensure that there is an
						even playing field among the political parties and candidates as well as penalties for overspending for the ad
						campaigns. It has, however, been revealed that candidates have been secretly spending much more than they are
						expected to be, with some candidates spending well over their own net-worth (Mangahas, 2019).

						One thing to take away from this is not only are some candidates are spending more than others but also the source
						of where these candidates acquired such a large sum to begin with. It was suggested that the resources from the
						pre-campaign ads were either hidden wealth or that these were donations to the candidate while in public office.
						If the latter were true, then such actions can be considered as a form of bribery which, at the moment, we have
						no means of determining.

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Then again, the cause for why candidates overspend during the pre-campaign may be justified for the reason that
						the given spending limit is too low for the funding of resources. With citizens stating that the existing
						25 year-old rates are no longer realistic for today&#39s standard (Rappler, 2019). Granted, in 2018, a bill regarding the increase
						of candidates&#39 spending limit was pushed by the senate (Felipe, 2018). The bill notes that although the amount is higher,
						it remains &quotconservative.&quot, with the amounts of the President and Vice President remaining at P10 per voter.
						Committee Report 497 showed that independent senatorial, party-list and other candidates may spend P6 to P8 per
						voter while candidates running under a political party or are being endorsed by political parties may spend P6
						per voter. It added that the existing cap of P5 for political parties has also been increased to P8 per voter.

						Although said increase was meant to discourage overspending by candidates, the recent election campaign still
						reported the amount of spending during the pre-campaigning was definitely over the limit. With everything I have
						mentioned, it&#39s safe to say that candidates aren&#39t exactly spending excessively on the campaign, but rather the
						set limit for such is quite low for the candidates&#39 standards. Given that I gave some explanation of why this
						matters, at the end of the day, one can only hope for luck after this year&#39s election.
