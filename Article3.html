				<h3 style = "font-size: 40px;"> Separation: Supposedly <i> Inviolable </i> </h3>

				<h6> By: Nicole Katherine G. Smith | 2019 May 12 </h6>

						&quotRender unto Caesar what is Caesar&#39s, and render unto God what is God&#39s.&quot As Jesus said in Matthew 22:21.
						There are things that belong under the state, and things that only belong under the church. Article 2 Section
						6 of the states, &quotSeparation of the Church and the State shall be inviolable.&quot Never to be broken, infringed,
						or dishonoured. 

					</h5>


					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						One of the reasons why the government is separate from the church is in times when the case being brought up is
						an accusation on a religious leader. The state can investigate without having to consider the position of the said
						leader in question since it will be none of the governments concern whether their position in the church is high or not (Fabie, 2015).

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Why should there be a separation of the church and the state? Because it is absurd to think that there would be a
						dominant religious belief, without thought on the other religions in the countries. Even if, say, the majority of
						the people in the country is under that religion (cough Christianity cough) we cannot put aside the minority.
						If this is the case, the minority will feel as if the state is against them. There is no feeling of equality.
						If the state and church is not separated, there will be no medium.

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Separation of myth and church is honestly a myth. If you remember the bill that the Kabataan Partylist tried to
						propose, the house bill 6330 sought to implement constitutional provisions on religious freedom. In which it will
						ban the displaying of religious items in government offices. The Catholic Church opposed the bill saying that it
						suppressed the government employees in practicing their religion. But Palatino (Kabataan representative) stated
						that the bill was for the government to not be seen favouring one religion.

					</h5> 


					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Question yourself, why is divorce illegal in the country? I think we all know the answer to this, because of morality.
						But the thing is, the government is not here to legislate morality. Not only is divorce in question, but also
						marriage equality, RH Law. The majority of people who debate against these issues keep on citing religious reasons.
						Ignoring the separation of myth and church, ignoring the minority, those people who live in the country but not
						under Christian religion.

					</h5>

						The separation of the government and the church has been nothing but a joke to this country. It is only ever brought
						up as an issue when the privileged people&#39s view on matters is challenged. We have been under influence of
						Christianity for 333 years, it is not a surprise to why the majority believe that it is normal to think that the
						government should conform to their beliefs. Those under the &quotmajor&quot religion in the country feel privileged, that
						when someone questions their beliefs, they consider it as prosecution. Not thinking how some of their beliefs can
						be considered as discriminatory to the minority, to the people who do not follow their beliefs. Under the state,
						we all should be treated as equal. No Christian. No atheist. No man. No woman. Only a person with rights, the same
						as any other person.
