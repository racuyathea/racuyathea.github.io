						To become a doctor in the Philippines, you need to pass high school, pass college, survive med school, pass a
						licensure exam, and do more years of training. To become a receptionist in the Philippines, you need to at
						least graduate with a bachelor&#39s degree in any field and have one year experience working in relation to the job
						you are vying for.

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						So what to do when you only have a high school diploma, in your 40&#39s, is bored with your current life and want
						to try something new? You can run for candidacy. President? Yes. Senator? Yes. Congresswoman? Yes. Will you win?
						Probably not, considering, you know, credentials. But the thing is, you can run. Which is honestly an issue
						that needs to be addressed in the country.

						Does it not baffle the people how there are candidates who run for senatorial positions that has no experience in
						law making whatsoever, that has no degree in law or anything even related to it? That the only thing they do know
						is how to spend one million pesos on an ad to make sure they get the vote of the people. The thing is, the senate
						is not a karaoke bar, nor a boxing ring, it is a place to make laws. How can we do that, when the people we might
						put in it, are even those who would back down when called to debate.

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						President, Vice President, Senator, and members of the House of Representative, have three things in common in
						their qualifications for candidacy: must be a natural born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, must
						be able to read and write (Bueza, 2015). Nowhere does it state any degree, on any position. Even just a single &quotmust be high
						school graduate&quot could be better than nothing at all.

					</h5> 

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						But wait, does qualifications even matter? Well duh. Of course. But why? Do voters even take the time to look at
						the salient issues of the candidate, their previous work, or even their educational background? Or do they just
						bandwagon, whoever&#39s poster they saw outside their office or television ad they saw at home would get the vote.
						Even worse, does eeny-meeny-miny-mo on the ballot the day of the election. The problem with these people, is that
						when the person they vote for suddenly turns out to be a pain in the- ehem. They accuse others and point fingers,
						blaming the government for the consequences, when they were the ones who put that person in the seat.

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						The contribution that qualifications gives to the voters, is that people get to know who the person is. They will
						be able to gauge the actions of the person. If the candidate has such a short resume, or a lengthy one but in
						no ways related to the position they are vying for, they will be unknown, the people would not know how this
						person is in times of crisis, how he makes decisions in times where he needs to. That is why this section in
						the constitution needs an upgrade, sadly if there ever could have been, it did not reach the coming elections.

					</h5>

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						According to Gatdula (2015), the clues that we need to look for in a candidates past are those that pertain to
						judgement, humility, and the ability to get things done. The people need to be wise and logical in choosing who to
						vote for and not just base the vote on popularity, especially considering all that has happened. We are tasked
						to vote for all that has not yet happened. It is in our hands, the faith of the state of the Philippines.
