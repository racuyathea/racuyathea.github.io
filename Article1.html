				<h3 style = "font-size: 40px;"> Netizens: Students have no right to meddle in politics </h3>

						With the upcoming Midterm Senatorial Elections just around the corner, social media netizens are unstoppable
						as soon as they start posting, sharing, and commenting on the hottest and latest issues in the political arena.
						For instance, several universities were roasted by the netizens for meddling in the political
						affairs of the country.

						While almost all of the law schools or student governments of the different universities conducted mock senatorial
						elections, the University of the Philippines, Saint Louis University, and San Beda University
						specifically received the most backlash from the netizens. To sum up the results, majority of the population from all universities voted for the candidates of the Otso
						Diretso with Chel Diokno, Samira Gutoc, and Bam Aquino on the top (Lucas, 2019).

						What made the polls more controversial were the comments of netizens saying <i> &#39wag kayong makisawsaw sa pulitika </i>
						(don&#39t meddle in politics). Aside from that statement, they also made fun of the students and claimed that they
						were still too young <i> (masyado pa kayong mga bata)</i> . Indeed, social media is a platform to freely express our feelings
						and opinions but that freedom is inseparable with responsibility and consequence.

						Personally, as a member of the youth, being told to stay out of politics basically means dropping my right to be
						informed of the issues of our home country. Politics is more than just governmental dynamics, it is how the elements
						of the state work together to ponder on societal, political, and economic issues. Mind you that two of the elements
						are the government and the people. It&#39s true that the people of my generation still have a long way to go in order
						to catch up with the millennials&#39 and generation x&#39s experience and practical wisdom, but it doesn&#39t mean that we
						cannot keenly observe and comprehend what&#39s happening around us.

					</h5> 


					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						Not to generalize, but the people who tell children to go to school and use what they&#39ve learned to raise awareness
						don&#39t even listen to them after they&#39ve become educated. What&#39s the purpose of exerting effort in learning
						contemporary issues when it&#39s just going to be left in school after graduation?

					</h5>

					<h5 align = "justify" style = "color: rgb(0,0,0); text-indent: 50px;">

						In the 2016 elections, 45.49% of registered voters belong to the youth age group (Lucas, 2019). Recent statistics
						from the mock elections essentially shows the trends and characteristics of the youth. They do vote differently
						from the rest of the population&#35rejecting the status quo. Maybe that&#39s the reason why they were bashed by fanatics.
						There is no doubt that the votes from the youth is also important in determining the next set of leaders.

						So, what do I say? What do we say? NO. We will not stop meddling in politics. It is duly our right to be informed of
						progresses and events that will either lead to the downfall or success of our country. Exercising the salient
						features of democratic relations between us fellow citizens serves as the backbone of a possible change we needed
						since the invasion of foreign colonizers. Ignorance is not an excuse when we can choose &#39not&#39 to stay ignorant.
